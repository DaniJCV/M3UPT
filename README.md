RTP channels don't open in most players. Perfect Player and ProgTV (configured with MediaPlayer engine) were the only ones that worked for me. If you know more players that can open them, let me know :)

## Recommended specs for Android TV boxes

For a good experience you need a decent CPU and enough RAM. As a general rule avoid CPUs made by Rockchip and Allwinner.

* **CPU**: Amlogic S905W2 (cheap, energy efficient and supports the latest AV1 video codec)
* **RAM**: 4 GB

Affordable Android TV boxes with Amlogic CPUs are usually much better supported than the ones powered by Rockchip or Allwinner. 
You can buy a decent device with the Amlogic S905W2 CPU and 4 GB of RAM for around 50 euros. Visit the recommended shopping websites below if you want to get one.
