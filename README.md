RTP channels don't open in most players. Perfect Player and ProgTV (configured with MediaPlayer engine) were the only ones that worked for me. If you know more players that can open them, let me know :)

## Recommended specs for Android TV boxes

* CPU: Amlogic S905X4, S905Y4 or S905W2 (all these support the latest AV1 video codec)
* RAM: 4 GB

Affordable Android TV boxes with Amlogic CPU are usually much better supported than the ones powered by Rockchip or Allwinner. You can buy a decent device with the Amlogic S905W2 CPU and 4 GB of RAM for around 50 euros.
